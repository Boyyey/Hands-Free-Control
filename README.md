🚀 Hands-Free Laptop Control 🎙️🖐️💻

🌟 Overview

Take control of your laptop using voice commands 🎤 and hand gestures ✋! This AI-powered assistant lets you open apps, switch tabs, manage system settings, adjust volume, scroll, and more—all without touching your keyboard! 🎯

With the power of speech recognition, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, this project turns your laptop into a futuristic assistant, making tasks quicker, easier, and more interactive. 🚀

🎯 Features

🔹 Voice Commands: Open apps, control media, adjust settings, and more using simple spoken commands. 🗣️

🔹 Hand Gestures: Increase/decrease volume, switch tabs, minimize windows, and scroll—all with your hands! ✋🤚

🔹 Shortcut Execution: Perform actions like creating new folders, deleting files, and opening Task Manager using your voice. 💡

🔹 Google Search Integration: Instantly search anything on Google with a simple voice prompt. 🔍

🔹 Screenshot Capture: Take a screenshot with a voice command and save it automatically. 📸

🔹 Shutdown & Lock: Secure or turn off your laptop without lifting a finger. 🔒💻

🛠️ Installation

📌 Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.

Install the required dependencies:

pip install speechrecognition pyautogui pyttsx3 opencv-python mediapipe

Make sure your microphone and webcam are enabled.

🚀 Usage

Run the script:

python script.py

👂 The assistant will start listening for commands and detecting hand gestures.

🎙️ Example Voice Commands

🗣️ "Open browser" → Launches Google Chrome 🌍🗣️ "Search Google for AI technology" → Opens a Google search 🔍🗣️ "Increase volume" → Turns up the sound 🔊🗣️ "Take screenshot" → Captures and saves a screenshot 📸🗣️ "Shut down laptop" → Powers off your system 💻

✋ Hand Gesture Controls

🖐️ Thumbs up → Increase volume 🔊🖐️ Thumbs down → Decrease volume 🔉🖐️ Swipe left → Switch tab left ⬅️🖐️ Swipe right → Switch tab right ➡️🖐️ Pinch gesture → Minimize window 📉🖐️ Raise hand up/down → Scroll up/down 📜

⚙️ How It Works

✅ Speech Recognition (speech_recognition) captures and processes your voice.✅ PyAutoGUI (pyautogui) executes keyboard and mouse actions.✅ Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3) provides verbal feedback.✅ OpenCV & MediaPipe track hand gestures for seamless control.

🎯 Future Improvements

🔹 More hand gestures for enhanced control.🔹 Integration with smart home devices 🏠🔹 Support for multiple languages 🌍🔹 AI-based customized commands 🤖
